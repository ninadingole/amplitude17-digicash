#Books Application

This is a sample application I designed to learn **nodejs** and **expressjs** framework.

Also I have added docker configurations so that you dont need to setup all the things after cloning the project just run

```bash
docker build -t [tagname]
```

and then,

`docker run -name bookapp -p 5000:5000 [tagname]`

To stop the cotainer:

`docker stop bookapp`
